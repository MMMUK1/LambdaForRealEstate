## Welcome
Here we explore newly-released Lambda formulae for Excel. In particular how this can strengthen, improve, simplify Institutional Cash Flows in Excel for Commercial Real Estate ('CRE') purposes.

## The problem

### Excel cash flows models built to invest in the largest asset class are too complex to build, edit and audit in a reliable manner.

CRE is the largest asset class in the world and has gone through a journey of professionalisation since the 1980s.  While now accepted alongside mainstream portfolio choices like bonds and equities, the state of underwriting in order to invest in this asset class is in need of improvement.  Investors such as Fund Managers, Private Equity Houses, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Family Offices and their advisors, brokers and lenders all suffer from similar paintpoints.  How to process, underwrite and project different scenarios with a degree of ease, transparency and agility in the workplace.

From a software perspective, the automation of cash flows via black-box tools commenced in the 1990s. While the North American discipline of modelling Discounted Cash Flows in Excel persisted. Many brokers, without the investment banking discipline or training of DCF modelling, resorted to black-box software such as Argus, MRI Software, KEL, etc. This led to a workforce blindly inputting assumptions into an unknown sausage machine and crossing fingers that the outputs were properly modelled, with no proper visibility of the detailed calcualtions. As software packages became more complex there is a trend whereby many investors are returning to the wonderful (but laborious) transparency of Microsoft Excel.

As institutional standards and deals have become more complicated, so has the complexity and depth of the requisite Excel modelling in CRE. When speaking to investors in stocks and equities, it's worth noting that they are often surprised at the complexity that arises in this modelling domain despite their impression that property is a relatively simple proposition compared to a company with shareholders, employees, overheads and a multiplicity of operations.

It is no surprise that Excel institutional modelling for CRE is deemed to be an aggravating, risky and time-consuming exercise by many Analysts from New York to London to Seoul. Complex models remain difficult to build, understand and edit. Let alone audit. The few that do pursue best-in-class practices and submmit themselves to rigorous audits by the likes of PwC or Deloitte, spend significant 6-figures and months of effort to audit the lifecycle of their latest model template. But as soon as new commercial pressures come to bare in the workplace, the neat theory between an audit manual and the professed lifecycle of the Corporate template desintegrates very quickly with any new butchering.

From an academic perspective, very few leading universities in the field of real estate have shown interest in Discounted Cash Flow ('DCFs') modelling. Any papers on this subject are difficult to find. In contrast, insitutional researchers in both academia and industry bodies (ANREV, INREV, RICS) seem more interested in overall industry performance, benchmarking of portfolios and spend relatively little attention on the daily reality of ground-up modelling that underpins any single asset before portfolios can be rolled up effectively for shareholders  or limited partners.

In summary, many CRE Analysts model complexity in Excel, audits are near impossible, and the building of a new institutional model should be a matter of hours rather than weeks.

## The Opportunity

### Hypothesis: to reduce CRE DCF model worksheets to a single formulae.

The consensus is that Microsoft's recent release of Lambda formulas makes is a fully-fledged progamming language. Most CRE Analysts do not consider themselves to be geeky programmers in a field that prizes sociable networking, smart deal sourcing and savvy deal closing/execution. Although they don't recognise it, all Associates, VPs and Managing Directors that get involved with CRE underwriting cash flow Excel models are "end-user" programmers.

The power in the hands of these users has increased by an order of magnitude thanks to the historic introduction of Lambda. Therefore, this must mean that the general construction of CRE models can be reassessed. The hypothesis is that a single page of worksheet modelling can be reduced (abstracted) to a common sense single command. That all Analysts should be able to follow a set of simple instructions to construct such a model. All without requiring programming training or knowledge of spreadsheet macros and VBA which, some would say, merged the worlds of technical programming and spreadsheet design in a risky manner which was out of reach to the millions of typical Excel users.

Even if each worksheet cannot be reduced to a single manually-written cell, the singular focus of this hypothesis represents the other end of a very realistic spectrum of Analyst work. The CRE industry works at the most complex end of the spectrum that requires weeks of work to build an institutional template. Microsoft Excel, if used correctly with Lambda, now offers unprecedented simplicity, speed and clarity at the other end of the spectrum. The prize is to build CRE Models within a day or two. Hopefully within one afternoon.

## The approach of this repository

There will be two main strands to this repository:

### 1. Notes, chapters and musings will be in the Wiki pages.

### 2. Lambda and Excel work in the Code section.
This will hopefully tie in some broad sense to the Wiki pages. (Note: I have chosen traditional Github rather than any specialised Git repo for *.xlsx diffs.  I believe the popularity of Github is important for potential multi-disciplinary feedback from a wider user base - plus I'm not sure whether *.xlsx diffs tracking is relevant for my research project).


## Join in – thoughts welcome from business and academia. Help certainly needed!
I very much welcome any thoughts from professional programmers, Excel enthusiasts, Academics and Analysts/Associates/MDs from the Commercial Real Estate field. Please feel free to make Pull Requests – whether they are for contributions to Lambda Excel technicalities or the narrative/general approach to the notes.
- Issues may help contribute to goals, change direction, add another string to an investigation, etc.
- Pull requests can help fix any Lambda / Excel documentation placed in Code.

Lambda and Excel technical worksheet content are subject to MIT licence (Code tab).  Please contact me if you wish to use my general writing, narrative and/or musings (Wiki / Projects tab).
