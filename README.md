# Lambda For Real Estate
This is a an online repository to create Lambda library for Discounted Cash Flows ('DCF'). The library is mostly geared to Commercial Real Estate examples, but the underlying LAMBDA principles serve DCF purposes across sectors.

## Welcome

Welcome! Here we explore how to make cashflow life exponentially easier for everyone.

## Who is this for?

It is for primarily professionals that already have built a cash flow Excel model for real estate investments. Discounted Cash Flow modellers in othe industries may also find the principles to be universally useful.

This Github is also linked to LinkedIN group: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9021786/. 

## Write formulas only ONCE 

The key objective is simple: write formulae once and avoid 'reinventing the wheel' in future real estate models. Imagine the team possibilities back at the office and time saving for winning new business.

Most professionals in Commercial Real Estate (CRE) remain unaware of the opportunities: i.e. If you created cashflow models for your team before 2022, it is time to brush up on new possibilities introduced since then.

Watch out for training companies, college courses & CPD time that still teach old pre-COVID ways of cashflow modelling. It's a new ball game out there. Knowing the difference elevates real estate underwriting skills to a whole new league of productivity.

## Approach

To avoid 'a solution finding a problem' tech syndrome, this repository is for addressing real estate questions first and answering them from a Lambda perspective.

Do post questions/ideas to make this group as useful as possible. Keep it CRE and Excel related! Thanks.

Best wishes,
