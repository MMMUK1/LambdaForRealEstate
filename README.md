# Lambda For Real Estate
This is a repo to create Lambda library for Discounted Cash Flows ('DCF'). The library is mostly geared to Commercial Real Estate examples, but the underlying LAMBDA principles serve DCF purposes across sectors.

## Welcome

## Objective

An organised library of LAMBDA functions should enable the faster assembly of an institutional cash flow.

An institutional cash flow model template can take over a year to scope, specify, design, implement, test for feedback and check via a proper audit. A single library can provide consistency, reliability and confidence by satisfying the essential Discounted Cash Flow requirements.

## Join in – thoughts welcome from business and academia. Help certainly needed!
I very much welcome any thoughts from professional programmers, Excel enthusiasts, Academics and Analysts/Associates/MDs from the Commercial Real Estate field. Please feel free to make Pull Requests – whether they are for contributions to Lambda Excel technicalities or the narrative/general approach to the notes.
- Issues may help contribute to goals, change direction, add another string to an investigation, etc.
- Pull requests can help fix any Lambda / Excel documentation placed in Code.

Lambda and Excel technical worksheet content are subject to MIT licence (Code tab).  Please contact me if you wish to use my general writing, narrative and/or musings (Wiki / Projects tab).

Best wishes,
